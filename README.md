# Lock free debug tools

Concurrency is hard but can improve speed of programs.
For that it must be well designed. As for all programs it must be with the less bugs as possible,
therefore we use and need tools to guide and correct us.

There are many technics to do concurrent programs and at some point we have to synchronize our threads to make them communicate.
These synchronizations can be effectively made with **locks** (eg: mutexes) or with **lock-free technics**
allowing our threads to cooperate enabling maximum concurrency (some thread makes progress every step).
This is also more robust, there is less dependencies with other threads (no locks).

Unfortunately lock-free programming has drawbacks and is more complicated than lock based counterpart.
For instance to design lock-free algorithms you must be sure to not break invariants all the time as you can't exclude other threads when updating things.
You must be aware of the order in which the data will be visible to other threads. And use atomics to avoid undefined behavior.
I will discuss about these problems in the next sections.

If you want an introduction to lock-free programming I would recommend you to read [this article](https://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming/) by Jeff Preshing.
And an in-depth book about concurrency: [C++ Concurrency in action](#cpp_concurrency_in_action) by Anthony Williams

## Problems in lock-free programming

### Data race

A data race is a situation in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time (unsynchronized), and at least one thread tries to modify the variable.

See an [example](./code/data_race/data_race_simple.cpp).

### Race Condition

A race condition is a situation in which the result of an operation depends on the interleaving of certain individual operations.

In red the data races, in green the race conditions ([code](./code/data_race/data_race_race_cond.cpp)):

![data race and race condition](images/data_race_race_cond.png)

### Memory reordering

Memory reordering can lead to a completely different program from the source code. This is due to compiler optimizations but also during runtime the processor may reorder stores and loads.

For example, can you guess possible outputs of this [program](./code/memory_ordering/store_load_relaxed.cpp) ?
(Suppose operations on x and y atomic):

```cpp
int main() {
  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
  int r1;
  int r2;
  std::thread      t1([&] {
    y = 1;  // #1
    r1 = x; // #2
  });
  std::thread      t2([&] {
    x = 1;  // #3
    r2 = y; // #4
  });
  t1.join();
  t2.join();
  std::cout << "r1: " << r1 << ", r2: " << r2 << "\n";
  return 0;
}

/* it could be:
r1: 0, r2: 1
r1: 1, r2: 0
r1: 1, r2: 1
right ? but this could also be:
r1: 0, r2: 0
it can arise if #1 #2 or #3 #4 are reordered (store/load reorder)
to prevent memory reordering use barrier or std::atomic with memory_order
(by default it is sequentially consistant)
*/
```

### Livelock

Livelock, like deadlock, is when one thread is waiting for
another, which is in turn waiting for the former.
The difference is the wait is non blocking but active such as spin-lock.

### Starvation

Starvation is when some thread(s) access shared part frequently preventing other thread(s) to make progress\
Lock-free program does not necessarily prevent starvation.

### false sharing

False sharing is when 2 variable accessed frequently be 2 different threads are on the same cache line,
thus the threads must acquire exclusivity of that cache line preventing real parallelism.

### ABA' problem

ABA can appear in lock-free program when using CAS (compare and swap),
[example](./code/aba/aba.cpp) or [example trying to provoc ABA](./code/aba/aba_detect.cpp)

![aba problem](images/pop_aba.gif)

Multiple solutions exist:

- Double length CAS with modification counter
- Reference counter ([shared_ptr with atomic](./code/aba/aba_fixed.cpp), not necessarily lock-free but portable C++11, simplified in C++20 `std::atomic<shared_ptr<>>`)
- Hazard pointers
- lazy garbadge collection
- garbage collector
- Not freeing memory

***note** lock-free programs are not necessarily starvation free*

## Tools

These tools have been tested on:

- <a name="m1"></a>Machine 1(M1): ArchLinux `Linux 5.1.15-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Jun 25 04:49:39 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux` (Intel i7-6700HQ (8 cores) 3.5GHz)
  - gcc version 9.1.0-2 (GCC)
  - clang version 8.0.0-4 (tags/RELEASE_800/final)

**Note**: Outputs may differs depending on compilers and options:

- Compilers:
  - gcc
  - clang
- Standard library:
  - libstdc++ (gnu)
  - libc++    (llvm)
- Options:
  - `-g`: debug info (file name, symbols, line:column number)

The tools will be tested with different options and differences will be reported.

The tools will be tested with small C++ programs (multiple times for dynamic tools), focused on lock-free.\

Each **test with error** will be run on a loop, for the first run it will not loop.
Then if the tool does not detect the error, we will try to loop 10 times and try again with 100 times and 1000 times.

Each **correct test** will be run on a loop, we will do 4 run: no loop, loop 10 times, loop 100 times, loop 1000 times.
For static tools we won't use loops of course

```

### Valgrind: [DRD](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html)

| Plateform:         | Linux/MacOS/Android 32/64bits |

#### DRD principal usage

DRD can detect data races, improper use of POSIX threads, false sharing,
deadlock and monitor lock contention. But can't detect wrong lock order.\
Also DRD support detached threads.

It is faster than Helgring but can be less precise.

By default DRD [does not check for local variable](#drd_stack_check) (stack).

1. Compile normally (with `-g` for debug info)
2. Run: `valgrind --tool=drd ./program`

***note**: you can colorize the output: `pip install colour-valgrind`*

#### [DRD options](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html#drd-manual.options)

<a name="drd_stack_check"></a>
`--check-stack-var=<yes|no> [default: no]`\
Controls whether DRD detects data races on stack variables.

`--segment-merging=<yes|no> [default: yes]`\
Segment merging is an algorithm to limit memory usage.
Disabling segment merging may improve the accuracy displayed in race reports but can also trigger an out of memory error.

`--suppressions=<suppressions-file>`\
Specify user suppressions file, [example with atomics](./valgrind.supp). [doc](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress)

`--gen-suppressions=all`\
Generate suppression for detected problem. Useful to rapidly suppress problem.

You can also annotate your code
to help DRD understand happens-before relation [example](./code/prod_cons/notif_acq_rel.cpp) with `std::atomic<>`.
Unfortunately this can silence errors if you get wrong with these, be sure to really understand you code before.
It may be possible to wrap annotations and check for ordering(std::memory_order) in user defined `atomic` class.

=> Check other [options](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html#drd-manual.options)

#### DRD tests

### Valgrind: [Helgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html)

|                    |                               |

| Plateform:         | Linux/MacOS/Android 32/64bits |

#### Helgrind principal usage

Helgrind can detect data races (concerned read/write position showed), improper use of POSIX threads,
deadlock linked to lock ordering problems.

It is more precise than DRD but slower.

By default Helgrind [checks for local variable](#hg_stack_check) (stack).

1. Compile normally (with `-g` for debug info)
2. Run: `valgrind --tool=helgrind ./program`

***note**: you can colorize the output: `pip install colour-valgrind`*

#### [Helgrind options](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html#hg-manual.options)

<a name="hg_stack_check"></a>
`--check-stack-refs=no|yes [default: yes]`\
This flag enables you to skip checking for accesses to thread stacks (local variables). This can improve performance, but comes at the cost of missing races on stack-allocated data.

`--track-lockorders=no|yes [default: yes]`\
Helgrind performs lock order consistency checking. If you're only interested in race errors, you may want to disable lock order checking.

`--history-level=none|approx|full [default: full]`\

- `full`: causes Helgrind collects enough information about "old" accesses that it can produce two stack traces in a race report: both the stack trace for the current access, and the trace for the older, conflicting access.\
Collecting such information is expensive in both speed and memory. You may not need it in situations where you just want to check for the presence or absence of races, for example, when doing regression testing of a previously race-free program.

- `none`: is the opposite. It causes Helgrind not to collect any information about previous accesses.

- `approx`: provides a compromise between these two. It causes Helgrind to show a full trace for the later access, and approximate information regarding the earlier access. This approximate information consists of two stacks, and the earlier access is guaranteed to have occurred somewhere between program points denoted by the two stacks. This is not as useful as showing the exact stack for the previous access but it is almost as fast as `none`.

You can also annotate your code, like DRD,
to help Helgrind understand happens-before relation [example](./code/prod_cons/notif_acq_rel.cpp) with `std::atomic<>`.
Unfortunately this can silence errors if you get wrong with these, be sure to really understand you code before.
It may be possible to wrap annotations and check for ordering(std::memory_order) in user defined `atomic` class.

=> Check other [options](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html#hg-manual.options)

#### Helgrind tests

Launch:

```bash
valgrind --gen-suppressions=all --suppressions=valgrind.supp --tool=helgrind ./prog
```

You can see [output samples](./outputs/helgrind.md).

[tsan_plateform]: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual#supported-platforms

#### ThreadSanitizer principal usage

ThreadSanitizer can detect data races (concerned read/write position showed), improper use of POSIX threads,
deadlock linked to lock ordering problems. [see more](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerDetectableBugs).\
It also [support `std::atomic<>`](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerAtomicOperations)

ThreadSanitizer as for other sanitizers is integrated in Gcc and Clang

1. Compile with `-fsanitize=thread` (and with `-g` for debug info)
2. Run normally: `./program`, you could use [./path_colorizer.sh](./path_colorizer.sh) to colorize paths to source.
3. you can pass options at runtime by [setting TSAN_OPTIONS variable](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags#runtime-flags)

#### [ThreadSanitizer options](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags)

There is [compile time options](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags#compiler-flags-llvm-specific).\
There is also options that can be [passed at runtime](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags#runtime-flags) avoiding recompilation.\
And also [common flags](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/SanitizerCommonFlags) with other sanitizer.

It is also possible to annotate code or [suppress warnings](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags#blacklist-format).

| Plateform:         | Linux/MacOS/Windows 32/64bits |

#### Intel Inspector principal usage

Intel Inspector can detect data race, deadlock, it partially support atomics (MSVC/Intel icc/Clang).

But it has some [limitations](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-inspector-2018-release-notes-issues-and-limitations),
especially C++11 Atomics on Clang/Gcc.

1. Compile normally (and with `-g` for debug info)
2. Run intel inspector or inspxe-cl command line

| Plateform: | On the web |

#### CppMem principal usage

CppMem has been designed to explore the C/C++ memory model. It support a tiny subset of pseudo C/C++ (no struct/classes)

1. Go to http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/
2. Write/enter your "program"
3. Run\
![how to run cppmem](images/cppmem/main/cppmem_run.png)
4. See different consistent executions\
![how to explore results cppmem](images/cppmem/main/cppmem_results.png)

You can use `std::thread` or you could use this syntax:

```cppmem
{{{
  {
    // thread1
  }
|||
  {
    // thread2
  }
}}}
```

#### Output explanation

![how to explore results cppmem](images/cppmem/main/cppmem_graph.png)

You could rapidly see on top global information about the current possible execution (races, locks, ...).\
Then the graph describing that execution.

- W: write
- R: read
- (R/W)na: non atomic R/W
- (R/W)(sc|rlx): atomic R/W (seq_cst|relaxed)
- Racq: atomic read acquire
- Wrel: atomic write release
- sb: sequenced before
- mo: modification order
- sw: synchronized-with
- hb: happens-before
- rf: read from
- dr: data race
- sc: sequentially consistant

More details on their [help page](http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/help.html).

#### Tests

We have to convert the C++ into CppMem syntax, some test aren't there because CppMem does not support features used in it.

### Other tools

There are some other tools not covered here with given reason:

- [Other sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki): these must be useful to catch other bugs not related to concurrency, check it out.
- [Relacy race detector](http://www.1024cores.net/home/relacy-race-detector):
  The code must be instrumented (unit test) and compiled C++03 or C++11 but `std::*` must be changed by `rl::*` [see example](./code/)
- [CDSChecker](http://plrg.eecs.uci.edu/software_page/42-2/): poor support of C++, old.
- [IFRit](https://github.com/blucia0a/IFRit): too old, based on old llvm/clang

### Notes

- To initialize something in concurrency (double checked locking)
think about using [static local variable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration#Static_local_variables)
- **Do not use [volatile](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerAboutRaces#volatile)** for synchronization!

## Summary

(SEE: if Intel inspector support lockfree)
Most tools have poor support of lock-free programming.\
CppMem can shows us what is going on in lock free but has serious limitations (no struct, tiny subset of pseudo C supported).

ThreadSanitizer can work well in lock-free context but has [not been seriously tested on that specific area[7]](#tsan_faq "TSan supports [...] C++ `<atomic>` operations are supported with llvm libc++ (not very thoroughly tested, though).") and there are no paper describing the new Thread Sanitizer (v2).

We had ideas for further testing, but due to lack of time we don't have tested:

- programs with more than 2 threads
- real examples
  - boost lock-free
  - TBB
  - PPLP (program develop at Verimag)
- More benchmark (on real examples)
  - Execution time
  - Memory overhead
- Other hardware:
  - ARM64
  - Verimag PC // TODO: see if we can test on verimag

Finally it would be interesting to do further testing on real lock free programs with TSan, as this haven't been done,
in order to potentially complete TSan specifically for lock-free programs.
